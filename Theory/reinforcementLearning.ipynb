    "2. An agent is an entity that interacts with an environment in order to learn how to make decisions that will maximize a specific goal or objective.\n",
    "3. The environment is an external sys or context in which the agent operates. The environment can be a simulation, a physical system, or any other system that the agent interacts with.
